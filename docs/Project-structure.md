## Directory and File Descriptions

### `src/`

The root directory of the application's source code.

### `src/app/`

Contains application-specific components, layouts, and pages.

-   `highlighted_note`: Here `(protected) & (homepage)` is the grouping method of route pages.

-   `(protected)/`: Directory for protected routes and associated components.

    -   `SampleRoutePage/`: Sample protected route page.
        -   `hooks/`: Custom hooks related to the SampleRoutePage.
        -   `components/`: Components specific to the SampleRoutePage.
        -   `layout.tsx`: Layout for the SampleRoutePage.
        -   `page.tsx`: Main content of the SampleRoutePage.



    -   `(homepage)`: Root public route.
      -   `components/`: Common components for public routes.
      -   `hooks/`: Shared hooks for public routes.
      -   `layout.tsx`: Default layout for public routes.
      -   `page.ts`: Main content of the root public route.
    -   `SampleRoutePage/`: Sample public route page.
        -   `hooks/`: Custom hooks related to the SampleRoutePage.
        -   `components/`: Components specific to the SampleRoutePage.
        -   `layout.tsx`: Layout for the SampleRoutePage.
        -   `page.tsx`: Main content of the SampleRoutePage.

-   `layout.tsx`: Default layout used for the entire application.

### `src/components/`

Reusable components used throughout the application.

-   `sampleComponent/`: Example reusable component.
-   `UI/`: Directory for common UI components.

### `src/hooks/`

Custom hooks used across the application.


### `src/types/`

Type definitions and TypeScript-related files.

### `src/utils/`

## Summary

Here every folder and file structure follows a modular approach, organizing code based on routes, components, hooks, styles, and utilities. The `src/app/` directory contains protected and public routes, each with their own components, layouts, and pages. Reusable components reside in the `src/components/` directory, and custom hooks are stored in the `src/hooks/` directory. While the `src/utils/` directory contains utility functions. Type definitions are located in `src/types/`.

This structure aims to promote modularity, code reusability, and maintainability for the Next.js application.
